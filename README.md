# DENIAL-OF-SERVICE-ATTACK
Ethical Hacking in Solidity in order to make smart contracts vulnerability-free: The Denial of Service attack 

What the denial of service attack does is that it restricts legitimate users from using the smart contracts permanently or for a certain period of time, which makes it unusable. When it comes to blockchain and smart contracts, there are 3 types of DoS attacks: 
1. Unexpected Revert
2. Block Gas Limit 
3. Block Stuffing 

We will focus here on the first one, Unexpected revert where the attacker uses a smart contract to make such an attack.
